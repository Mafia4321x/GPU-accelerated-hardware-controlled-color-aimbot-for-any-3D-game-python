Hello guys, today I am releasing my color aimbot coded in python

It uses dxcam for screen capture so it is gpu accelerated (Credits to ra1nty on github)

It then utilizes the razer synapse dll driver for Razer mice that directly controls the mouse movement through the onboard mobo (Credits to 0736b (Thanawat) on github)

This script includes the following functions:

1. *find_color_in_frame*: Finds target colors in a given frame using a specified tolerance.
2. *calculate_weighted_average_position*: Calculates the weighted average position of detected pixels in a bounding box.
3. *move_mouse*: Simulates mouse movement using the `ctypes` library.
4. *move_cursor_to_position*: Moves the cursor to a target position in small steps.
5. *send_coordinates_to_server*: Sends the coordinates of the cursor to a server using a socket connection.
6. *toggle_circle_overlay*: Toggles the visibility of a circle overlay on the screen.
7. *start_circle_thread*: Starts a thread to display a circle overlay around the mouse pointer.
8. *draw_circle_around_mouse*: Updates the position of the circle overlay to follow the mouse pointer.
9. *main*: The main function that runs the color tracking and cursor movement logic.

The reason why this is in a discuss thread is because it dosent work for VAL yet and I need your guy's help to make it happen. This works in Aimlabs, Overwatch, CSGO and many more probably.

Please give me suggestions and code iterations so that I can release this to valorant! Your help will not go un-noticed. Thanks.

Install python then install vscode and also install python within vscode


(1.)Run main.py first
(2.)Then run colorbot.py
Also make sure to install razer synapse 3 with the macro module installed


Code:
pip install numpy
pip install tkinter
pip install pyautogui
pip install pillow
pip install dxcam

Multiple files within one block make sure to seperate them. (5 files: Colorbot.py, main.py, rzctl_nt.py, rzctl.py, server.py)

This was also posted in the Valorant thread if you want to check it out there, but for the release version it is going to be a download.

Version 4.5 for Razer:

I hope you guys would take the time to leave suggestions and make contributions. Thank you again
